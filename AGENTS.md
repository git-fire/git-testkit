## Agentic guardrails

These notes apply to humans and to automated agents (including Cloud Agents).

1. **Autonomous work comes first**  
   The default posture is to **finish useful work without unnecessary human gates**. Prefer actions that keep momentum (fetch, build, test, open PRs) over asking for permission for routine steps—while still honoring the hard safety rules below.

2. **Multi-repository work is encouraged**  
   When a task genuinely spans more than one codebase (services, libraries, docs, sibling CLIs), work across **multiple repositories or local clones** as needed. Open **one PR per repository**, keep each PR scoped, and **link related PRs** in every description so reviewers see the coordinated change.

3. **Stay on a fresh enough tip; rebase is optional**  
   Before substantive work: `git fetch origin`, check out your branch, then prefer **`git merge --ff-only origin/<branch>`** (or `git pull --ff-only` when upstream exists). If you cannot fast-forward, pause and use the repository’s normal merge or rebase workflow—**do not** silently work on a stale checkout. **`git pull --rebase`** is *ideal* when updating an active feature branch, but it is **not required**; a merge commit or team-standard flow is fine when it avoids needless churn.

4. **Force-push is never automatic and needs explicit human buy-in**  
   Do **not** run `git push --force`, `git push --force-with-lease`, or rewrite published history on your own. If you believe it might be warranted, **stop** and give the **human** explicit **reasoning**, **effects** on collaborators, CI, and open PRs, and **why** a force-push would be needed versus safer alternatives (new branch, revert, merge). Proceed **only** after they **explicitly approve** that exact repository and branch.

5. **Focused changes and verification**  
   Keep pull requests focused; run this repository’s standard build, test, and lint commands (see `README`, `Makefile`, or `CLAUDE.md`) before requesting review.

6. **Workflow shape is yours**  
   Using **git worktree** versus a single working directory is an **operator choice**; these docs do **not** require worktrees.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

This is a **pure Go test-utility library** with zero external dependencies beyond the Go toolchain and `git` CLI. There are no services, databases, or containers to start.

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.22+ and `git` must be on `PATH` (both are pre-installed in the Cloud Agent VM).

### Key commands

All commands are run from the repo root (`/workspace`):

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Lint (vet) | `go vet ./...` |
| Format check | `gofmt -l *.go` |
| Format fix | `gofmt -w *.go` |
| Run tests | `go test ./...` |
| Verbose tests | `go test -v ./...` |

See `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` for full contributor workflow and PR checklist.

### Caveats

- The full test suite (`go test ./...`) takes ~90 seconds due to `TestCreateMultiBranchScenario`, `TestSnapshotAndRestore`, and `TestCreateTestRepo_Dirty` which create many git commits. Use `go test -short ./...` for faster iteration if the tests under change don't need the large-repo scenarios.
- `gofmt` is the only formatting tool used; there is no `golangci-lint` config.
